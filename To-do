- Validate user enters numbers for cost and duration
- validate user fills in all fields
- validate that user doesn't use symbols or dashes for project name, user name, room name
- refactor views
- refactor controllers - use memoization where possible

Questions
- does total room cost belong in database, or just as a method?
- nested paths -- what's the best convention?
- can't get check logic to work
- where should session / login controller actions go?
