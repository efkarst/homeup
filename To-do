- update cost and time to be integers, validate i get numbers as inputs
- validate user fills in all fields
- validate that user doesn't use symbols or dashes for project name, user name, room name
- refactor 'totals' methods into separate module
- refactor views
- refactor controllers - use memoization where possible
- remove data tables & columns I don't need
- update text boxes to wrap text



Questions
- does total room cost belong in database, or just as a method?
- nested paths -- what's the best convention?
- can't get check logic to work
- where should session / login controller actions go?
